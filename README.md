# What is this project?

This is an Angular based web app that tracks temperature data.

## Development server

Before you could start a development server, you need to install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
